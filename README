THIS PROJECT IS NOT FINISHED!!!

It shouldn't even really be in a runnable state at this point.

As a short intro to what it is/is going to be:

This is a generic log templator program that can keep track of mundane things
like how often you brush your teeth, and more important things like billable
hours for contract work. It lets a user construct a template, log information
into it, and print this information in various output formats. And it performs
most of this through execution hooks that make the program highly user extensible.

Until it's done though, this readme is my todo list:

1. Refactor CliFieldEditor() so that it uses a dictionary to store field attributes.

2. Add a field width minimum and maximum specification with types to CliFieldEditor.

3. Modify logprinter so that it takes field lengths from user set ftype fields 
instead of just defaults from oformat scripts.

4. Add 'reload' functionality so that log entries can be edited and field 
templates can be edited.

5. Write a manual explaining the data model, use model, and operation of the 
program.

6. Add support for unbounded maximums.

7. Rewrite loginit in logger.py
