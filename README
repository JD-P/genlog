THIS PROJECT IS NOT FINISHED!!!

It shouldn't even really be in a runnable state at this point.

As a short intro to what it is/is going to be:

This is a generic log templator program that can keep track of mundane things
like how often you brush your teeth, and more important things like billable
hours for contract work. It lets a user construct a template, log information
into it, and print this information in various output formats. And it performs
most of this through execution hooks that make the program highly user extensible.

Until it's done though, this readme is my todo list:

1. Remove the 'main' functionality in both logger.py and cli_interface.py and
move this sort of handling into a 'boot_interface.py' that lets features of the
program be accessed from a command line invocation.

2. Remove the 'options' function in cli_interface.py and replace it with a 
suitable field template and script.

3. Finish the log printing functionality.

4. Add 'reload' functionality so that log entries can be edited and field 
templates can be edited.

5. Write a manual explaining the data model, use model, and operation of the 
program.

6. Replace print_iterable with pprint.
